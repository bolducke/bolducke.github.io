The RBF interpolation from scipy is widely use in the community. However, the library is limited by a set of pre-defined kernel functions and lack of parallelization.

Through JAX, I was able to make a program that is:

* Flexible by letting you choose the kernel and the norm
* Differentiable by making easy to compute the gradient
* Parallelizable by taking advantage of JAX parallelization system 

*Feel free to make a comment if you see any mistake*
