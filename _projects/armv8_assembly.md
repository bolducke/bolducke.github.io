## Motivation

On my journey to learn more about performance-aware programming, I wanted/needed to learn how programs are executed on the CPU. Even though my education has been closely related to computer science, I never delved into the intrinsics of a computer. Most of my computer science courses focused on algorithmics, mathematical proofs, simulations, etc.  

## Description

This project is a collection of small programs in ARMv8:

* Hangman
* more to come...
