I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Graphics at [LIGUM](http://www.ligum.umontreal.ca/),Udem with [Pierre Poulin](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~poulin) as my advisor. I am interested in Geometry Processing, Sketch Processing, Rendering and Scientific Modeling.. My research and development experience includes working at Ubisoft La Forge, where I worked to extend Poisson Filters for arbitrary surfaces. I'm expected to finish in 2023.

I completed my undergraduate degree at Udem in 2021 doing a double honor major in Physics and Computer Science. During my studies, I developed strong mathematical and problem-solving skills, enabling me to quickly understand and apply complex concepts.
