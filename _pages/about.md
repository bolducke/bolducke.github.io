I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Graphics at [LIGUM](http://www.ligum.umontreal.ca/), Université de Montréal ([UdeM](https://www.umontreal.ca/) ) with [Pierre Poulin](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~poulin) as my advisor. I mainly work on Sketch Processing modeling and am interested in Geometry Processing, Rendering, Scientific Modeling and more. My research and development experience include research internships at [Ubisoft La Forge](https://www.google.com/search?q=ubisoft+laforge&oq=ubisoft+laforge&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i10i512l2.2875j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), where I was in charge of extending Poisson Filters for arbitrary surfaces and at UdeM with Normand Mousseau on acccelerating potential energy computation. 

I graduated with honors in 2021 with a bachelors degree in a double honor major in Physics and Computer Science at UdeM. I expect to finish in 2023.
