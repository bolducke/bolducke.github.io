I am a master student in Computer Graphics at [LIGUM](http://www.ligum.umontreal.ca/), Université de Montréal ([UdeM](https://www.umontreal.ca/)) with [Pierre Poulin](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~poulin) as my advisor. In my undergraduate year in 2021, I did a double major in Honors Physics and Computer Science at the same university, where I was exposed to a large array of ideas and mathematical tools. My master's degree was filled with fun as I discovered how the concepts I learned in my physics undergrad applied to my studies.

My current focus is on geometric problems that overlap with various areas of computer science. More specifically, I have put effort into learning about geometry processing and classical computer vision, including Shape-from-Shading. My research and development experiences include research internships at [Ubisoft - La Forge](https://www.google.com/search?q=ubisoft+laforge&oq=ubisoft+laforge&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i10i512l2.2875j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), where I was working on extending Poisson Filters for arbitrary surfaces and at UdeM with Normand Mousseau on accelerating interatomic potential computation.

Besides research, I have a strong interest in international politics, am a foodie, and am passionate about discovering new Indie games. I'm also trying to swim more, but I have not been as disciplined as I would have liked...
