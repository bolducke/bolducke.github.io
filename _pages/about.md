This website is in WIP. This picture is totally me.

I'm a master's student in Computer Science at [LIGUM](http://www.ligum.umontreal.ca/), Université de Montréal, advised by [Pierre Poulin](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~poulin) and working on Computer Graphics related topics. I have experience in scientific modelling and simulation as well as knowledge in machine learning and web development. For more information on me, please read my CV and visit my Linkedin account.

Currently, I'm mostly working on sketch processing. I'm expected to finish in 2023.
